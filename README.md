# Fetching external data

## Overview

This project involves fetching external data from the file system and pre-rendering the index page using this data. The process involves utilizing the `gray-matter` npm package to handle the extraction of data from files and integrating it into a Next.js application for rendering.

## Prerequisites

To use this project, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You'll also need npm (Node Package Manager) to install the necessary dependencies.

## Installation

1. **Node.js and npm**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. **Next.js**: To install Next.js, run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm create-next-app my-app-name
   ```


3. **Gray-matter**: You'll also need to install the `gray-matter` package:

   ```bash
   npm install gray-matter
   ```

## Usage

To effectively fetch external data from the file system and pre-render the index page using Next.js and `gray-matter`:

1. Organize your data files within the designated directory.
2. Utilize `gray-matter` to extract relevant data from these files.
3. Implement the pre-rendering process using the extracted data to generate the index page or any desired output within your Next.js application.

Refer to the Next.js documentation for creating pages and routes, and `gray-matter` documentation for efficiently handling file data extraction.

## Example

Here's a basic example of how you might use `gray-matter` in a Next.js application:

```javascript
// This is a sample code snippet, adjust paths and functionalities as needed
import fs from "fs";
import matter from "gray-matter";

// Read the file
const fileContent = fs.readFileSync("path/to/your/file.md", "utf8");

// Extract front matter and content
const { data, content } = matter(fileContent);

// Utilize the data and content as needed
console.log("Front matter:", data);
console.log("Content:", content);
```

Please adjust this code to fit your project's structure and requirements within a Next.js application.
